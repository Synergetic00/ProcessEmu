# ProcessEmuFX

Mass processing project folder loader using JavaFX with custom GUI loader and 2D capabilities, 3D if an updated library is able to be added

## Roadmap

* v0: Get project to actually run with Java 8 properly
* v1: Running code in text files at runtime
* v2: Getting most basic graphic functions working
* v3: Lots of code from Processing reimplemented to try get PGraphics working
* v4: Complete re-write from scratch using my own structures
* v5: Yet another re-write using my own 2D graphics library
* v6: Adding 3D features once they have been implemented
